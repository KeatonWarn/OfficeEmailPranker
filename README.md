Using an Elgato Streamdeck and your coworker's nosiness, you can have a good laugh by letting them own-goal themselves. Written in Python.

The .gif files are supposed to go directly on the C: root, but obviously you can change the paths in the code and put them elsewhere or use other gifs - or none at all.

Story:
I set up an Elgato Stream Deck button to play a gif, telling a specific coworker to not push the button. This bait triggered an executable I wrote in Python that would spam his inbox.

To add some pizzazz, the executable had the unsuspecting coworker choose a level of damage - 1 being low, 2 being medium, and 3 being epic - even though the target coworker didn't know what he would be damaging. The emails would send and a funny .gif file would play on the monitor. Naturally, the coworker who found this wanted to see what all three levels did since they loaded different .gif files.

It took a few weeks for anyone to notice the flashing button on my desk. A non-target coworker found it, pushed it several times, and then showed it to the target coworker, who then also activated the executable a number of times. Fifteen minutes later, he found his inbox full of emails that he had triggered.

The cherry on top was he had been talking about network security and how he couldn't be duped into accidentally compromising anything through social engineering.

We had a great time and quite a few laughs.
